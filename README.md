# Car Resale Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression

This repository contains Python code for predicting car resale prices using two different regression techniques: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately predict the resale price of cars based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner history.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their features and resale prices. It includes the following columns:

- Car_Name
- Year
- Selling_Price
- Present_Price
- Kms_Driven
- Fuel_Type
- Seller_Type
- Transmission
- Owner

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-resale-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd car-resale-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the `car_resale_price_prediction.py` script to train and evaluate the linear regression and Lasso regression models:

   ```
   python car_resale_price_prediction.py
   ```

## Results

The results of the prediction models, including evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score, are displayed in the terminal/console. Additionally, visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices are generated for both training and test data.
